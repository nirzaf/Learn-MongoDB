## Project Summary

This project aims to build a sophisticated, interactive learning platform for MongoDB, using a modern tech stack including NextJS, Prisma, and TailwindCSS/Chakra UI. The platform will guide users through a structured learning path, from foundational concepts to expert-level mastery, featuring an interactive code playground, progress tracking, and advanced tools like schema visualization and a code challenge system.

- [ ] Prisma is added as a project dependency.
- [ ] `schema.prisma` file is created and configured for a MongoDB provider.
- [ ] The application successfully connects to a local or Atlas MongoDB instance using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
- [ ] A Prisma Client can be generated successfully.
**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** SETUP-003

**Task ID:** DB-002
**Title:** Define Core Data Models in Prisma Schema
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define the core data models for Users, Modules, Lessons, and UserProgress so that the application has a clear data structure.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `User` model is defined (name, email, password, etc.).
- [ ] `Module`, `Lesson`, and `Challenge` models are defined to represent the learning pathway structure (Tier 1-4).
- [ ] `UserProgress` model is defined to link users to lessons and track completion status.
- [ ] Relationships between models (e.g., User to UserProgress, Module to Lessons) are correctly defined.
**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** DB-001

**Task ID:** DB-003
**Title:** Implement Database Seeding for Learning Content
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a seeding script so that I can populate the database with initial learning modules and lessons for testing and development.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A script (`prisma/seed.ts`) is created.
- [ ] The script populates the database with data for at least Tier 1 (MongoDB Fundamentals).
- [ ] The seed script can be executed via an `npm` command.
**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** DB-002

### 4. UI - Core User Interface and Component Library

**Task ID:** UI-001
**Title:** Design and Build Core Application Layout
**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent and intuitive application layout so that I can easily navigate between different sections like the dashboard, learning modules, and my profile.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A main layout component with a sidebar/navigation bar and a content area is created.
- [ ] Navigation links are present for key areas.
- [ ] The layout is responsive and works well on desktop and mobile devices.
- [ ] A shared component library is started for common elements like buttons, inputs, and cards.
**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** SETUP-002

**Task ID:** UI-002
**Title:** Build Learning Module Interface
**User Story:** As a learner, I want a clear and organized interface for viewing learning modules and lessons so that I can easily follow the learning pathway.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A page lists all available learning modules (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2).
- [ ] Clicking a module reveals a list of its lessons.
- [ ] The user's progress (e.g., completed lessons) is visually indicated on this interface.
- [ ] The interface fetches and displays data from the database.
**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** UI-001, DB-003, AUTH-001

### 5. CONTENT - Learning Module and Content Management Framework

**Task ID:** CONTENT-001
**Title:** Develop Lesson Page Structure
**User Story:** As a learner, I want to view the content of a specific lesson, including text, code snippets, and instructions, so that I can learn the material.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A dynamic route `/[moduleId]/[lessonId]` is created to display lesson content.
- [ ] The page renders lesson content (e.g., from Markdown or a rich text field in the DB).
- [ ] A "Mark as Complete" button is present.
- [ ] Navigation to the previous and next lessons is available.

## Estimation Guidelines

These are relative estimates to aid in planning.
* **Simple:** Can be completed by a single developer in 1-2 days.
* **Medium:** Requires focused effort for 3-5 days; may involve multiple components.
* **Complex:** A significant feature that could take 1-2 weeks; may be an "epic" requiring its own breakdown.
